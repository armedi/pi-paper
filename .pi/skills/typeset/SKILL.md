description: Improves typography by fixing font choices, hierarchy, sizing, weight, and readability so text feels intentional. Use when the user mentions fonts, type, readability, text hierarchy, sizing looks off, or wants more polished, intentional typography.

Assess and improve typography that feels generic, inconsistent, or poorly structured — turning default-looking text into intentional, well-crafted type.

## MANDATORY PREPARATION

Invoke /impeccable — it contains design principles and anti-patterns.

## Assess Current Typography

Analyze what's weak or generic about the current type:

1. **Font choices**:
   - Are we using invisible defaults? (Inter, Roboto, Arial, Open Sans, system defaults)
   - Does the font match the brand personality? (A playful brand shouldn't use a corporate typeface)
   - Are there too many font families? (More than 2-3 is almost always a mess)

2. **Hierarchy**:
   - Can you tell headings from body from captions at a glance?
   - Are font sizes too close together? (14px, 15px, 16px = muddy hierarchy)
   - Are weight contrasts strong enough? (Medium vs Regular is barely visible)

3. **Sizing & scale**:
   - Is there a consistent type scale, or are sizes arbitrary?
   - Does body text meet minimum readability? (16px+)
   - Is the sizing strategy appropriate for the context? (Fixed `rem` scales for app UIs; fluid `clamp()` for marketing/content page headings)

4. **Readability**:
   - Are line lengths comfortable? (45-75 characters ideal)
   - Is line-height appropriate for the font and context?
   - Is there enough contrast between text and background?

5. **Consistency**:
   - Are the same elements styled the same way throughout?
   - Are font weights used consistently? (Not bold in one section, semibold in another for the same role)
   - Is letter-spacing intentional or default everywhere?

**CRITICAL**: The goal isn't to make text "fancier" — it's to make it clearer, more readable, and more intentional. Good typography is invisible; bad typography is distracting.

## Plan Typography Improvements

Consult the [typography reference](reference/typography.md) from the impeccable skill for detailed guidance on scales, pairing, and hierarchy.

Because this repository works in Paper, inspect the document typography before styling: start from `get_basic_info`, call `get_font_family_info` before the first typographic styling in the session, and prefer fonts already loaded in the document unless the user asks otherwise.

Create a systematic plan:

- **Font selection**: Do fonts need replacing? What fits the brand/context?
- **Type scale**: Establish a modular scale (e.g., 1.25 ratio) with clear hierarchy
- **Weight strategy**: Which weights serve which roles? (Regular for body, Semibold for labels, Bold for headings — or whatever fits)
- **Spacing**: Line-heights, letter-spacing, and margins between typographic elements

## Improve Typography Systematically

### Font Selection

If fonts need replacing:
- Choose fonts that reflect the brand personality
- Pair with genuine contrast (serif + sans, geometric + humanist) — or use a single family in multiple weights
- Ensure the chosen family and weights are actually available in Paper before styling

### Establish Hierarchy

Build a clear type scale:
- **5 sizes cover most needs**: caption, secondary, body, subheading, heading
- **Use a consistent ratio** between levels (1.25, 1.333, or 1.5)
- **Combine dimensions**: Size + weight + color + space for strong hierarchy — don't rely on size alone
- **App UIs**: Use a fixed `px`-based type scale in Paper, optionally adjusted at 1-2 breakpoints in exported code if needed
- **Marketing / content pages**: In Paper, define clear fixed `px` sizes for headings and display text. If the user later asks for code export, those values can be translated into fluid behavior where appropriate

### Fix Readability

- Set comfortable text measure in the layout so paragraphs stay around 45-75 characters where practical
- Adjust line-height per context using explicit `px` values in Paper: tighter for headings, looser for body
- Increase line-height slightly for light-on-dark text
- Ensure body text is at least 16px

### Refine Details

- Use `tabular-nums` for data tables and numbers that should align
- Apply proper `letter-spacing` using `em`: slightly open for small caps and uppercase, default or tight for large display text
- Use semantic token names (`--text-body`, `--text-heading`), not value names (`--font-16`)
- Set `font-kerning: normal` and consider OpenType features where appropriate

### Weight Consistency

- Define clear roles for each weight and stick to them
- Don't use more than 3-4 weights (Regular, Medium, Semibold, Bold is plenty)
- Use only the weights you actually need in the composition

**NEVER**:
- Use more than 2-3 font families
- Pick sizes arbitrarily — commit to a scale
- Set body text below 16px
- Use decorative/display fonts for body text
- Disable browser zoom (`user-scalable=no`)
- Use unsupported or unavailable font families / weights without checking `get_font_family_info` first
- Default to Inter/Roboto/Open Sans when personality matters
- Pair fonts that are similar but not identical (two geometric sans-serifs)

## Verify Typography Improvements

- **Hierarchy**: Can you identify heading vs body vs caption instantly?
- **Readability**: Is body text comfortable to read in long passages?
- **Consistency**: Are same-role elements styled identically throughout?
- **Personality**: Does the typography reflect the brand?
- **Availability**: Are the chosen font families and weights available in Paper and applied consistently?
- **Accessibility**: Does text meet WCAG contrast ratios? Is it zoomable to 200%?

Remember: Typography is the foundation of interface design — it carries the majority of information. Getting it right is the highest-leverage improvement you can make.
